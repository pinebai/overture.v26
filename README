         Overture: A Framework for Solving PDEs
         --------------------------------------

See the Overture home page at http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/Overture

See the installation instructions on the web (or in Overture/doc/install.tex)

Please note that the Overture framework is developed as part of our research
into better ways to solve partial differential equations. It is under constant
development and redesign. It is certainly not complete. We appreciate any help
you can give us to improve the software.
