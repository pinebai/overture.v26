Test routines for Overture

Type checkop.p to run some tests and compare the results to some reference results:
    tderivatives    : tests derivatives in the operators.         
    tbcc            : tests boundary conditions for coefficient matrices.  
    tbc             : tests explicit boundary conditions.                   
    tcm3            : tests coefficient matrix solver on a CompositeGrid 


You can also run the tests separately.

Other test routines here are 

  tcm.C, tcm2.C ... : examples to test coefficient matrices

  testInterpolate.C : test interpolation
  
  testIntegrate.C   : test integration on overlapping grids

  tz.C : test twilight-zone functions

  giMain: test routine for the graphics interface

  paperplane: test routine for motif and OpenGL (if giMain fails, tehn maek sure
       this routine works)

  thdf1.C, dbex1.C dbex2.C dbex2a.C : tests for the HDF data-base.
