  This primer directory holds the examples found in the primer documentation.
  
  You must first build Overture before you can build these examples.

  Type "make" to make the some of the examples found here. (You must define the 
  same environemental variables as were needed to build Overture -- see the Overture/REAME
  file or the section on Makefiles and .cshrc files in the primer documentation)

  You can also type "make mappedGridExample1" to just make one thing.

  The command files for generating grids are now located in the sampleGrids directory
  The overlapping grid examples require an overlapping grid to have been made.
