Most of these command files test the rap program and can be run through the perl scripts check.p 
and heal.p. They can also be run independently, for example, with "rap ship-5415-fix.cmd". Note that
the check and heal scripts also attempt to run examples that we are unable to distribute, but the 
scripts should ignore any files that don't exist.

Some of these command files generate some of the Mapping's shown
in the Mapping documentation. To run one of these examples:
   1) start ogen
   2) choose 'create mappings' from the pop-up menu
   3) choose 'read command file' from the file pull-down menu
   4) enter the name of the command file to read.
