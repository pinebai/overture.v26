Overlapping grids
-----------------
  Type "make" in this directory to build a collection of sample grids.
  This will run the the perl script generate.p. and check to see that
  the grids are correctly made by comparing the results to previously
  generated single or double precision results.

  Most of the files named *.cmd are command files that cam be used to create overlapping grids
  using the grid generator, ogen, found in Overture/bin 

  The file GridDescriptions gives a short description of some of the command files
  found in this directory. 

  See the documentation of ogen for a description of how to build overlapping grids
  like the ones that can be created here.

  If you start ogen you can read in the command file by choosing the menu item
  "read command file" found in the "file" menu (upper right corner of the window).
  You can type "ogen file.cmd" to directly read the command file.
  You can also type "ogen noplot file.cmd" to run without graphics and to have
  ogen read the command file "file.cmd" and generate the grid.


Unstructured (Hybrid Grids)
---------------------------
 
  You can build unstructured (hybrid) grids using "ogen". Ogen will call the "ugen"
grid generator to take an overlapping grid and turn it into an unstructured grid.
There are a number of sample .hyb.cmd files in this directory to build hybrid grids.
See for example, inletOutlet.hyb.cmd or valve.hyb.cmd. To build one of these examples
type
      ../bin/ogen inletOutlet.hyb.cmd


Grids From CAD
--------------
  The script gridsFromCad.p will build some grids from CAD geometries. 

  The files named asmo*.cmd can be used to build a grid on the "asmo" automobile. The
  asmo geometry is defined as a CAD surface saved in an IGES file (asmo.igs).
  The basic steps are
          1. ../bin/rap asmoNoWheels.cmd
          2. ../bin/mbuilder asmoBody.cmd
          3. ../bin/mbuilder asmoFrontWheel.cmd
          4. ../bin/mbuilder asmoBackWheel.cmd
          5. ../bin/ogen asmo.cmd
  Most of these command files will pause so you can see what is going on.
  See the documentation for the hyperbolic mapping for more detailed 
  instructions on building the asmo grid.
